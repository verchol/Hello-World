Code Fresh Demo
Demo to visualize CodeFresh main pages.
This app was created with Yeoman Angular generator.

Contains:
1. '/' - main page of projects list.
2. '/new-project' - wizard page of creating a new project

Installation:
1. Run 'npm install' for installing npm packages.
2. Run 'bower install' for installing bower components.
3. Run 'grunt' for building app. Grunt runs several tasks including compass compiling, js + css concatentaion, and tests.

Usage:
Run 'grunt serve' for running a local server and browse to 'localhost:9000' to view app.

Distribution:
All files reside under 'dist' folder inside the main application folder.
Compass products including compiled CSS can be found in 'dist/styles' folder.
In order for CSS to be more readable, there's a need to configure the way Compass compiles .scss to .css
All options for that can be viewed here - https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass.
